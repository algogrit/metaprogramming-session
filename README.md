Metaprogramming
===============

Metaprogramming is the art of writing programs that re-write themselves in order to simplify execution and to to make things more readable by humans. It is often employed in the creation of DSLs, which are short for Domain Specific Language. DSL's can be very useful if employed properly.

This repo is intended to contain materials for a simple introduction to metaprogramming.

Current Intended languages to be touched are:
---------------------------------------------
* Ruby
* Javascript
* Clojure

More will be added later. As maturity and understanding increases.
